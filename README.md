## Problem Statement
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Security_by_Obscurity_is_not_that_good-blue?style=for-the-badge)
* In the present developing digital world everyone has their own identities in various platforms. So, definitely every user has to maintain their social accounts validly using their unique mail ids. 
* When it comes to a Question that whether all credentials related to the accounts possessed by an individual can be remembered! Definitely one cannot remember every password set by him/her.

## Objective 
* Here comes our project where one can store their password securely like in a vault. 
* Whenever the user needs to know the password/secret note, he/she can easily retrieve the password from the application. 
* A web based application where the user needs to register with us and then they can store and retrieve credentials easily from us.
